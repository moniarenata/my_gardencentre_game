# my_gardencentre_game
beginner friendly game

I love going to the garden centre and coding, so why not combining two things I'm passionate about :)
Here's an explanation of my simple game:

The program starts by asking the player to type their name and then greets them with a welcome message.

The game sets the scene: the player is at a garden centre and must choose to go to either the seed or flower section.

The player types their choice, and .lower() makes sure it’s in lowercase so it matches the expected input.

If the player chooses "seed":

They are told they can’t find seed packets and are given two new options: order online or get a cake.

If they choose online, the game says they ordered seeds online and went home.

If they choose cake, the game says they ordered a cake and went home.

If they type anything else, the game tells them it’s not a valid option.

If the player chooses "flower":

They see weak flowers and must decide whether to buy them or not.

If they say yes, the game says the plants recovered after watering at home.

If they say no, they go to a different garden centre and meet a friend who invites them for coffee.

If they choose shop, they continue shopping after planning a catch-up with the friend.

If they choose coffee, they go for coffee and get free flowers from the friend.

If they type anything else, the game says it’s not a valid option.

If the player doesn’t choose either seed or flower at the start, the game says it's not a valid option.

The game ends with a thank-you message.
